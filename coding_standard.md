# this is a document detailing utachi coding standard for my own personal project incase this project is gona actually scale we will revise this later

## Function

### function naming 
1. Incase function naming is a standalone function ie: not in a class or object of some sort use snake case.

2. if function is a part of an object or class use Camel case

3. Function name should be as short as possiable but still retain it full meaning ieL handle_arguments or register route. 

4. function should have a short discription on what it dose iether following python standard using """""" or just a simple comment

### function code layout
1. each function should ideally dose 1 thing BUT incase where it have to do or call mutiple function each "segments" should have it own sub comment define the secton

2. Each function should ideally be annotated meaning type of the input and output argument known

3. all function should be an async function when possiable
